                    The Oxalix programming language is a conceptual programming language based around the concepts given in the talk <i>The Post JavaScript Apocalypse</i> by Douglas Crockford. Oxalic has no keywords, better allowing for variable names to contain spaces. Below is an Oxalic hello world script, where <em>to whom</em> is the variable name, <em>"world"</em> is the value, and the section in brackets is to be displayed in the terminal.<br><br>
                    This language is still conceptual and only transpiles into Python code at the moment. This language is not production ready, and still needs time to mature and become functional. Only basic print and varaible functionality works at the moment. Oxalic is a temporary hobbyist project that is fully open-source, and anyone can use the basic syntax for their own projects if they want to make their own Oxalic implementation.<br><br>
